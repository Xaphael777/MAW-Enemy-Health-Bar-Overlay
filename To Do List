Short Term

- check submitted error logs
- Simplify the install process
    -have the lua auto detect screen resolution and directory path like the python script does.

Long Term
- add visual effect on bar depletion on a crit
- improve the look of the settings GUI
- add icons for monsters highest and lowest resistance
- add icons for immunities
- tie the amount of information bars diplay to party's Monster ID skill

On Hold

- Heal over Time effects?
- integrate scrolling combat log (currently in development, not working)
